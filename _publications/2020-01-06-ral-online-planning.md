We present a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) algorithm to generate trajectories in real-time for multiple
robots. We adopted the on-demand collision avoidance method
presented in previous work to efficiently compute non-colliding trajectories in transition tasks. An event-triggered replanning strategy
is proposed to account for disturbances. Our simulation results
show that the proposed collision avoidance method can reduce, on
average, around 50% of the travel time required to complete a
multi-agent point-to-point transition when compared to the wellstudied Buffered Voronoi Cells (BVC) approach. Additionally, it
shows a higher success rate in transition tasks with a high density
of agents, with more than 90% success rate with 30 palm-sized
quadrotor agents in a 18 m3 arena. The approach was experimentally validated with a swarm of up to 20 drones flying in close
proximity.
