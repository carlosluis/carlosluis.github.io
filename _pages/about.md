I am a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Paris, France. I have worked on the large-scale drone delivery project known as Amazon Prime Air, in safety-critical mission planning components.

I completed a MSc in the University of Toronto, where I did research in multi-robot motion planning at the [Dynamic Systems Lab](dynsyslab.org) under [Prof. Angela Schoellig](https://www.dynsyslab.org/prof-angela-schoellig/). You can find more info about my work in the [Publications]( {{ author.url }}/publications) page.
