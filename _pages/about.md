I am a Game AI intern at [Sony AI](https://ai.sony/){:target="_blank"}, working on
Reinforcement Learning for large-scale videogames. I completed my PhD in 2024 at the
Technical University of Darmstadt in collaboration with the
[Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com/){:target="_blank"}
(BCAI). The goal of my research is to enable real-world agents that efficiently learn
from experience.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Paris,
France. I was part of the large-scale drone delivery project known as Amazon Prime Air,
where I worked on safety-critical mission planning components.

I completed a MSc in the University of Toronto, where I did research in multi-robot
motion planning at the [Dynamic Systems
Lab](https://www.dynsyslab.org){:target="_blank"} under [Prof. Angela
Schoellig](https://www.dynsyslab.org/prof-angela-schoellig/){:target="_blank"}. You can
find more info about my work in the [Publications]( {{ base_path }}/publications) page.
