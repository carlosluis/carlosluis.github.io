I am a PhD Candidate at the [Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bosch-ai.com/){:target="_blank"} (BCAI), working on safe and efficient model-based reinforcement learning. The goal of my research is to enable real-world systems to operate robustly under uncertainty.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Amazon in Paris, France. I was part of the large-scale drone delivery project known as Amazon Prime Air, where I worked on safety-critical mission planning components.

I completed a MSc in the University of Toronto, where I did research in multi-robot motion planning at the [Dynamic Systems Lab](https://www.dynsyslab.org){:target="_blank"} under [Prof. Angela Schoellig](https://www.dynsyslab.org/prof-angela-schoellig/){:target="_blank"}. You can find more info about my work in the [Publications]( {{ base_path }}/publications) page.
